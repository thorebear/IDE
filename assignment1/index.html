<!-- What should the accompanying text say about the visualization -->
<!-- What story would the combination of text and visualization tell. -->
<!-- Who is the intended audience. -->
<!-- Where would you get the dataset from.  -->

      <p>The best Danish football league 'The Danish Superliga' was established in 1991, and currently the best 12 teams in Denmark are participating in the 26th season of the league.</p>
	    <p>Each season of the league is easily summed up in a table showing the final standing, even the all-time standing (how the teams has performed when combining all 26 seasons) can (and is) summed up in a table. These standings are fine when we are interested in the outcome of a season (who won the title? who was relegated? etc.),  but in my opinion they lack an interesting piece of information: How was the route of a team to its final position? Was the bronze winner placed in the lower part of league in first half of the season, and did a magnificent comeback to archieve the bronze medals, or was they placed in the first place in most of the season, just to see their championship dreams falling a part in the last matches?</p>
	    <p>My idea is the make an interactive view, which show every teams position after each round of any season. It should be possible to select which season to view, and which teams to explorer. Here is a mockup showing the idea, where a single season and 3 teams selected.

      <p>An addition feature could be to combine seasons, and e.g. show the view from round 1 in season 1992/1993 to round 33 in season 1999/2000. If this feature exists, it is important to state how we convert results between seasons, since a victory in some seasons give 2 points and 3 points in other.</p>
      <p>All the data exists on <a href="http://superstats.dk">SuperStats.dk</a>.</p>

      <p>During the danish elections in the early summer 2015, I noted a for me, new tree-ish like visualization communicating where the voters are voting and relations with their voting history. I have added a <a href="http://www.dr.dk/nyheder/politik/valg2015/vaelgervandringer#K2015">link to the visualization, here </a>, otherwise click the image below.</p>
      <p>	Interactivity could be introduced by fine-graining the view to zoom in at geographic areas, educations, institutions, etc.</p>
      <p>I imagine the same kind of visualization could produce some very convincing, storytelling of social inheritance, educational level of young citizens,	pace of education, stress disorders and other interesting markers, this should be visualized over several years, identifying whether the implemented	policies work as intended.</p>
      <p>The intended audience should be the politicians and voters, documenting the	consequences of those decisions made.</p>
      <p>This dataset, is probably collected by 'danmarks statistik' for national data, but local educational institutions, would have to collect and report the data.</p>

    <h2>Accessing the server</h2>
    <p>The server used to host the website is a private server located at Mads' home in Helsingør. The server has lots of diskspace available, and enough <abbr title="Random Access Memory">RAM</abbr> to launch hundreds of threads simultaneously (4GB), and as it is private, the entire system is at our hands, no qoutas. The CPU is not very fast though (Intel Celeron 2 cores, 2.1GHz, 64bit), and no serverfarm is backing up the site on the computational side. The <abbr title="Internet Service Provider">ISP</abbr> connection could also be a potential bottleneck, if the local network is busy doing other private transactions over the internet. The connection is something like 15/2 Mbps, so just 2 Mbit per second upload. If we refrain from serving videos and the like, the data transactions from this machine should be limited amounts of raw data, the purpose of using javascript is to make the visualizations happen locally on the clients, not the server.</p>
    <p>The server is accessed via ssh, and the files are moved to the server by 'pulling' a git repository when logged on to the server. The git repo is hosted on github.
