<!-- 2. Place a small and interesting image in the lower or upper right corner of the page. Do this using only javascript (i.e. nothing in the <body>..</body> section should reflect the existence of the image).  -->

<!-- 3. List at least 4 links to interactive visualizations (not made by you) and describe positive and negative aspects for each of them.  -->
<!-- 4. Individual part: For each member in the group, describe an interactive visualization that you would like to be able to build after this course has finished. If possible include elements like: -->
<!-- What should the accompanying text say about the visualization -->
<!-- What story would the combination of text and visualization tell. -->
<!-- Who is the intended audience. -->
<!-- Where would you get the dataset from.  -->
<!-- A sketch or mockup of the visualization -->

         <p>The best Danish football league 'The Danish Superliga' was established in 1991, and currently the best 12 teams in Denmark are participating in the 26th season of the league.</p>
	 <p>Each season of the league is easily summed up in a table showing the final standing, even the all-time standing (how the teams has performed when combining all 26 seasons) can (and is) summed up in a table. These standings are fine when we are interested in the outcome of a season (who won the title? who was relegated? etc.),  but in my opinion they lack an interesting piece of information: How was the route of a team to its final position? Was the bronze winner placed in the lower part of league in first half of the season, and did a magnificent comeback to archieve the bronze medals, or was they placed in the first place in most of the season, just to see their championship dreams falling a part in the last matches?</p>
	 <p>
	   My idea is the make an interactive view, which show every teams position after each round of any season. It should be possible to select which season to view, and which teams to explorer. Here is a mockup showing the idea, where a single season and 3 teams selected.   
	 </p>
	 <div class="center">
	   <img src="mockup.svg" width="700px">
	 </div>
         <p>An addition feature could be to combine seasons, and e.g. show the view from round 1 in season 1992/1993 to round 33 in season 1999/2000. If this feature exists, it is important to state how we convert results between seasons, since a victory in some seasons give 2 points and 3 points in other.</p>
         <p>All the data exists on <a href="http://superstats.dk">SuperStats.dk</a>.</p>

	 <p>During the danish elections in the early summer 2015, I noted a for me,
				new tree-ish like visualization communicating where the voters are voting
				and relations with their voting history.
				I have added a <a href="http://www.dr.dk/nyheder/politik/valg2015/vaelgervandringer#O2015-seneste">link</a>
				to the visualization posted on dr.dk.
				Interactivity could be introduced by fine-graining the view to zoom in at
				geographic areas, educations, institutions, etc.</p>

	 <p>I imagine the same kind of visualization could produce some very convincing,
				storytelling of social inheritance, educational level of young citizens,
				pace of education, stress disorders and other interesting markers, this
				should be visualized over several years, identifying whether the implemented
				policies work as intended.</p>

	 <p>The intended audience should be the politicians and voters, documenting the
				consequences of those decisions made.</p>

	 <p>This dataset, is probably collected by 'danmarks statistik' for national data,
				but local educational institutions, would have to collect and report the data.</p>
