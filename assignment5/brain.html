	 <p>As opposed to the visualization of the molecule, this visualization have no light added, since the directions in the visualization is very clear without light. It is clear since the visualization consists of brain pictures, and the user can at any time and with any rotation see in which direction the brain should go. The camera is moved and rotated a little when the visualization is initialized, to make the viewer aware that the visualization consists of three planes. If the camera was just looking straight at the middle, the user could only see one plane, before he/she rotated or moved the camera. </p>
