	 <p> The size of the molecule makes it impossible to get any meaningfull view of the whole molecule, so the idea of this visualization is to give the viewer an opportunity to navigate around in the molecule and explore part of it at a time. We have added light to the scene, so it is possible to see the directions in the molecule even after the viewer has rotated the scene. If the scene did not have light it would be impossible to know which direction was 'up' in molecule after any rotation. We have also decided not to show any atoms (and bounds) which lays to far away for the camera for 2 reasons: 1) If the number of atoms is too high the scene needs alot of computer power to renderer and 2) atoms place so far from the camera that they are no larger than a point probably do not help the viewer interpreting the visualization. We could have added some fog to show that atoms far away was hidden.</p>
